# Project: Spotify Track Recommendation System 🎵

Explore my Music Track Recommendation System project, where I harnessed data from a comprehensive Spotify tracks dataset to develop an advanced content-based recommendation system. By leveraging attributes like track features and analytics, I crafted a personalized track recommendation system using cosine similarity.

# Key Achievements:

## 🎶 Data Transformation: 
Processed a dataset containing over 20,000 Spotify tracks, with each artist's top ten popular tracks. Cleaned, organized, and optimized data to facilitate effective recommendation.

## 🎧 Content-Based Recommendations: 
Engineered a content-based recommendation mechanism using cosine similarity. Input a track, and the system generates the top 5 most similar tracks, enhancing user music discovery.

## 🔗 Attribute Insights: 
Explored a plethora of track features and analytics, including danceability, energy, key, loudness, speechiness, and more. Leveraged these attributes for accurate recommendations.

## ⚖️ Feature Scaling & Weighting: 
Employed advanced techniques like feature scaling and attribute weighting to enhance the recommendation process. Used correlation analysis to assign initial weights, enhancing feature importance.

## 🚀 Interactive Functionality: 
Developed a user-friendly recommendation function. Input the track name, and the system outputs 5 comparable tracks based on feature similarity using cosine similarity.


This project showcases my ability to translate raw data into user-centric recommendations. By tapping into track attributes and undertaking sophisticated analysis, I've demonstrated my proficiency in personalized recommendation systems. This endeavor reflects my passion for music technology and data-driven solutions.
